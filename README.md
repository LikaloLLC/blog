# blog
Blog for Likalo LLC and Docsie.io
This is an example of a blog made for https://docsie.io. 

We decided to switch to have our blog hosted on github pages, because AWS infrastructure where our static content was hosted previously is slow and clunky, while the infrastructure that github provides is lightning fast. We ran trace route on many sites and determined that github pages is the fastest when it comes to turn around time of a request. Thus we are going to be migrating all our static content which is currently on https://docsie.io over to github pages while keeping the server and the API component on AWS, until we find something faster. 

The point of this blog is to serve as an example of simple docsie deployment as well as serve as serve as our corporate blog at https://blog.docsie.io for: www.likalo.com, www.metrics.im, www.hanba.io and https://docsie.io
